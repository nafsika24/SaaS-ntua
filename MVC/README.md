# :gear: **MVC Architecture**

MVC Web App: https://mvc-askmeanything.herokuapp.com/

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Each architecture component is built to handle specific development aspect of an application.

The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.

The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.

The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application.

In this web app the controller communicates with the model and the view as shown below.
